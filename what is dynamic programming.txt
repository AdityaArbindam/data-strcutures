Dynamic Programming:-
Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. 


In dynamic progamming we store the overlapping problems so that we don't have to recalculate those problems again and agian.s
